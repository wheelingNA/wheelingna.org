        <h3>The Twelve Traditions of NA</h3>
        <p>We keep what we have only with vigilance, and just as
          freedom for the individual comes from the Twelve Steps, so
          freedom for the group springs from our Traditions.</p>
        <p>As long as the ties that bind us together are stronger than
          those that would tear us apart, all will be well.
        </p>
        <p>1. Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery
          depends on NA unity.</p>
        <p>2. For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority—
          a loving God as He may express Himself in our group
          conscience. Our leaders are but trusted servants; they do
          not govern.</p>
        <p>3. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop using.</p>
        <p>4. Each group should be autonomous except in matters
          affecting other groups or NA as a whole.</p>
        <p>5. Each group has but one primary purpose—to carry the
          message to the addict who still suffers.</p>
        <p>6. An NA group ought never endorse, finance, or lend the NA
          name to any related facility or outside enterprise, lest
          problems of money, property, or prestige divert us from our
          primary purpose.</p>
        <p>7. Every NA group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining
          outside contributions.</p>
        <p>8. Narcotics Anonymous should remain forever nonprofessional,
          but our service centers may employ special workers.</p>
        <p>9. NA, as such, ought never be organized, but we may create
          service boards or committees directly responsible to those
          they serve.</p>
        <p>10. Narcotics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence
          the NA name ought never be drawn into public controversy.</p>
        <p>11. Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than
          promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at
          the level of press, radio, and films.</p>
        <p>12. Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our Traditions,
          ever reminding us to place principles before personalities.
          <p>Understanding these Traditions comes slowly over a period
            of time. We pick up information as we talk to members and visit
            various groups. It usually isn’t until we get involved with service
            that someone points out that “personal recovery depends on
            NA unity,” and that unity depends on how well we follow our
            Traditions. The Twelve Traditions of NA are not negotiable.
            They are the guidelines that keep our Fellowship alive and free.</p>
          <p>By following these guidelines in our dealings with others,
            and society at large, we avoid many problems. That is not to
            say that our Traditions eliminate all problems. We still have to
            face difficulties as they arise: communication problems,
            differences of opinion, internal controversies, and troubles
            with individuals and groups outside the Fellowship. However,
            when we apply these principles, we avoid some of the pitfalls.</p>
          <p>Many of our problems are like those that our predecessors
            had to face. Their hard won experience gave birth to the
            Traditions, and our own experience has shown that these
            principles are just as valid today as they were when these
            Traditions were formulated. Our Traditions protect us from the
            internal and external forces that could destroy us. They are
            truly the ties that bind us together. It is only through
            understanding and application that they work.</p>
