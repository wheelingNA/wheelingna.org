        <h3>Just for Today</h3>
        <p>Tell yourself:</p>
        <p>JUST FOR TODAY my thoughts will be on my recovery,
          living and enjoying life without the use of drugs.
        </p>
        <p>JUST FOR TODAY I will have faith in someone in NA who
          believes in me and wants to help me in my recovery.</p>
        <p>JUST FOR TODAY I will have a program. I will try to follow it
          to the best of my ability.</p>
        <p>JUST FOR TODAY, through NA, I will try to get a better
          perspective on my life.</p>
        <p>JUST FOR TODAY I will be unafraid. My thoughts will be on
          my new associations, people who are not using and
          who have found a new way of life. So long as I follow
          that way, I have nothing to fear.</p>
