          <h3>What Is the
            Narcotics Anonymous
            Program?</h3>
          <p>NA is a nonprofit fellowship or society of men and women for
            whom drugs had become a major problem. We are recovering
            addicts who meet regularly to help each other stay clean. This
            is a program of complete abstinence from all drugs. There is
            only one requirement for membership, the desire to stop using.
            We suggest that you keep an open mind and give yourself a
            break. Our program is a set of principles written so simply that
            we can follow them in our daily lives. The most important thing
            about them is that they work.</p>
          <p>There are no strings attached to NA. We are not affiliated
            with any other organizations. We have no initiation fees or
            dues, no pledges to sign, no promises to make to anyone.
            We are not connected with any political, religious, or law
            enforcement groups, and are under no surveillance at any
            time. Anyone may join us regardless of age, race, sexual
            identity, creed, religion, or lack of religion.</p>
          <p>We are not interested in what or how much you used or who
            your connections were, what you have done in the past, how
            much or how little you have, but only in what you want to do
            about your problem and how we can help. The newcomer is
            the most important person at any meeting, because we can
            only keep what we have by giving it away. We have learned
            from our group experience that those who keep coming to our
            meetings regularly stay clean.</p>
