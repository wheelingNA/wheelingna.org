        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>If you want what we have to offer, and are willing to make the
          effort to get it, then you are ready to take certain steps. These
          are the principles that made our recovery possible:</p>
        <p>1. We admitted that we were powerless over our addiction, that
          our lives had become unmanageable.</p>
        <p>2. We came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves
          could restore us to sanity.</p>
        <p>3. We made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the
          care of God as we understood Him.</p>
        <p>4. We made a searching and fearless moral inventory of
          ourselves. </p>
        <p>5. We admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human
          being the exact nature of our wrongs.</p>
        <p>6. We were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects
          of character.</p>
        <p>7. We humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.</p>
        <p>8. We made a list of all persons we had harmed and became
          willing to make amends to them all.</p>
        <p>9. We made direct amends to such people wherever possible,
          except when to do so would injure them or others.</p>
        <p>10. We continued to take personal inventory and when we were
          wrong promptly admitted it.</p>
        <p>11. We sought through prayer and meditation to improve our
          conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying
          only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry
          that out.</p>
        <p>12. Having had a spiritual awakening as a result of these steps,
          we tried to carry this message to addicts, and to practice
          these principles in all our affairs.</p>
        <p>This sounds like a big order, and we can’t do it all at once.
          We didn’t become addicted in one day, so remember—easy
          does it.</p>
        <p>There is one thing more than anything else that will defeat
          us in our recovery; this is an attitude of indifference or
          intolerance toward spiritual principles. Three of these that are
          indispensable are honesty, open-mindedness, and willingness.
          With these we are well on our way.</p>
        <p>We feel that our approach to the disease of addiction is
          completely realistic, for the therapeutic value of one addict
          helping another is without parallel. We feel that our way is
          practical, for one addict can best understand and help another
          addict. We believe that the sooner we face our problems within
          our society, in everyday living, just that much faster do we
          become acceptable, responsible, and productive members
          of that society.</p>
        <p>The only way to keep from returning to active addiction is
          not to take that first drug. If you are like us you know that
          one is too many and a thousand never enough. We put great
          emphasis on this, for we know that when we use drugs in any
          form, or substitute one for another, we release our addiction
          all over again.</p>
        <p>Thinking of alcohol as different from other drugs has caused
          a great many addicts to relapse. Before we came to NA, many
          of us viewed alcohol separately, but we cannot afford to be
          confused about this. Alcohol is a drug. We are people with the
          disease of addiction who must abstain from all drugs in order
          to recover.</p>
