        <h3 style="padding-top:.5em">Why Are We Here?</h3>
        <p>Before coming to the Fellowship of NA, we could not
          manage our own lives. We could not live and enjoy life as other
          people do. We had to have something different and we thought
          we had found it in drugs. We placed their use ahead of the
          welfare of our families, our wives, husbands, and our children.
          We had to have drugs at all costs. We did many people great
          harm but most of all we harmed ourselves. Through our
          inability to accept personal responsibilities we were actually
          creating our own problems. We seemed to be incapable of
          facing life on its own terms.</p>
        <p>Most of us realized that in our addiction we were slowly
          committing suicide, but addiction is such a cunning enemy of
          life that we had lost the power to do anything about it. Many of
          us ended up in jail or sought help through medicine, religion,
          and psychiatry. None of these methods was sufficient for us.
          Our disease always resurfaced or continued to progress until
          in desperation we sought help from each other in Narcotics
          Anonymous.</p>
        <p>After coming to NA, we realized we were sick people. We
          suffered from a disease from which there is no known cure. It
          can, however, be arrested at some point and recovery is then
          possible.</p>
