        <h3>We Do Recover</h3>
        <p>When at the end of the road we find that we can no longer
          function as a human being, either with or without drugs, we all
          face the same dilemma. What is there left to do? There seems
          to be this alternative: either go on as best we can to the bitter
          ends—jails, institutions or death—or find a new way to live. In
          years gone by, very few addicts ever had this last choice.
          Those who are addicted today are more fortunate. For the first
          time in man’s entire history, a simple way has been proving
          itself in the lives of many addicts. It is available to us all. This is
          a simple spiritual—not religious—program, known as Narcotics
          Anonymous.
