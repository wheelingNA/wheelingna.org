        <h3>Who Is an Addict?</h3>
        <p>Most of us do not have to think twice about this question.
          We know! Our whole life and thinking was centered in drugs
          in one form or another—the getting and using and finding
          ways and means to get more. We lived to use and used
          to live. Very simply, an addict is a man or woman whose
          life is controlled by drugs. We are people in the grip of a
          continuing and progressive illness whose ends are always
          the same: jails, institutions, and death.</p>
