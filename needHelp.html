      <h3 class="c-help__outro">What is the Narcotics Anonymous Program?</h3>

      <p class="c-help__outro--p">NA is a nonprofit fellowship or society of men and women for whom drugs had become a
        major problem. We are recovering addicts who meet regularly to help each other stay clean. This is a program of
        complete abstinence from all drugs. There is
        only one requirement for membership, the desire to stop using.We are not interested in what or how much you used
        or who your connections were, what you have done in the past how much or how little you have, but only in what
        you to do about your problem and how we can help.</p>

      <p class="c-help__outro--p">The simple message of Narcotics Anonymous is… “That an addict, any addict, can stop
        using drugs, lose the desire to use and find a new way to live."</p>
