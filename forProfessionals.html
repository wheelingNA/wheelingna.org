<h3>Resources for Professionals</h3>
			
				<p align="left">Narcotics Anonymous sprang from the Alcoholics Anonymous Program of the late 1940s, with meetings first emerging in the Los Angeles area of California, USA, in the early Fifties. The NA program started as a small US movement that has grown into one of the world's oldest and largest organizations of its type.</p>
<p align="left">Today, Narcotics Anonymous is well established throughout much of the Americas, Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Newly formed groups and NA communities are now scattered throughout the Indian subcontinent, Africa, East Asia, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. Narcotics Anonymous books and information pamphlets are currently available in 41 languages.</p>

<p align="left">For more information about our program, we invite you to review some of the items described below. </p>

<p align="left"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.na.org/admin/include/spaw2/uploads/pdf/PR/Information_about_NA.pdf"><strong>Information about NA</strong></a>: Includes facts about the history of NA, organizational philosophy, and membership demographics.</p>

<p align="left"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.na.org/admin/include/spaw2/uploads/pdf/litfiles/us_english/Booklet/NA%20Resource%20in%20Your%20Community.pdf"><strong>NA: A Resource in Your Community</strong></a>: This pamphlet provides information about local NA services that may be available such as public service announcements, phonelines, literature sales, and NA presentations for health fairs, schools and professional conferences. </p>

<p align="left"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.na.org/admin/include/spaw2/uploads/pdf/litfiles/us_english/Booklet/In%20Times%20of%20Illness.pdf"><strong>In Times of Illness</strong></a>: This relied-upon booklet was recently revised to reflect members&rsquo; experiences with challenges such as mental health issues, chronic illness and pain, and supporting members with illnesses.

This piece is intended for groups as they consider this issue. It does not address members&rsquo; personal decisions, nor does it try to change members&rsquo; opinions about medication. Groups are often better able to carry the message and welcome everyone when members come together to discuss this issue.</p>
